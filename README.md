# Projects done during my UG senior year

when i started my undergrad during 2019, I got introduced to JAVA. At this point I had 0 knowledge of web development, SDLC or pretty much anything about computer science concepts except for a tiny spec of C++ knowledge.
So, i pursued JAVA and slowly progressed with the concepts associated with a software application ( memory management, fornt-end, back-end, servers and a LOT more ). since then, I've used JAVA as my main stack for the next few years. 
now I've switched multiple frameworks, programming-languages and databases.

My point is... when I was a newbie developer, I was extremely inexperienced but had good programming skills and I had no idea of what version control was (IKR, what a dumb kid !). so, during the academic year of 2021-2022 (a year before my senior year),
I worked on two CAPSTONE projects but never made it live or stored it in a remote repository. The only proof I have for these projects are the official documentations that I did for those projects.
